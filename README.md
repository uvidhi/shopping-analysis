# Shopping Dataset Analysis

## Objective

The goal of this project was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a shopping dataset and understand patterns related to product ratings, pricing, discounts, popularity, and category-wise performance. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and deriving meaningful insights from data.

## Libraries Used

For this project, I used the following Python libraries:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* ZipFile
* OS

These libraries were used for data processing, visualization, file extraction, and file management tasks.

## What I Did

### Data Loading

* Extracted the dataset from a ZIP file.
* Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

### Data Exploration

* Checked the shape of the dataset.
* Examined column names and data types.
* Used `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()` to understand the dataset.

### Data Cleaning

* Identified missing values.
* Handled null values where required.
* Converted price-related columns into numeric format.
* Removed duplicate records.

### Feature Engineering

Created additional columns to improve the analysis:

* Saved Amount = Initial Price − Final Price
* Popularity Score = Rating × Ratings Count

### Analysis Performed

* Univariate Analysis
* Bivariate Analysis
* Category-wise Analysis

### Visualizations

Created different visualizations to better understand the dataset:

* Histograms
* Bar Charts
* Boxplots
* Correlation Heatmap

## Key Findings

During the analysis, I found that most products had ratings above 4.0, indicating generally positive customer satisfaction. Products with a higher number of reviews were usually more popular, highlighting the importance of customer feedback. Discounts played a major role in reducing product prices and attracting customers. I also observed that some categories consistently performed better than others in terms of ratings and popularity.
